Thankfully, the majority of my other mods don't need any patches beyond those which are already present on the page, but I did come across a few item placements/general clean-up which I thought I'd share :) Many of these are extremely minor and honestly not always necessary, but ESLs don't take up a plugin slot, so....why not?",
