Quick note on the "files" field: I know that ignoring files through it is not recommended as there's no official behavior (and, indeed, NPM and PNPM give different packing results when doing so depending on how you define stuff), however using .npmignore produced no results when testing locally--both with NPM and PNPM. Might be a bug, I don't know. What I do know is that this works. Either way, not the biggest deal in the world if some *.test.ts file gets included in the package.
